# Network-Devices

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Router
Function: Connects multiple networks together and directs data packets between them.

Use Case: Connects a home or office LAN to the internet.

#### Key Features:

Assigns IP addresses using DHCP.

Uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to share a public IP.

Often includes a firewall for security.

#### Types:

Wired Router â€“ connects via Ethernet cables.

Wireless Router (Wi-Fi Router) â€“ connects devices wirelessly.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Switch
Function: Connects devices within a LAN and forwards data to the specific device it's intended for.

Use Case: Used in offices or data centers to interconnect computers, printers, servers.

#### Key Features:

Works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).

Uses MAC addresses to forward data intelligently.

Can be managed (configurable) or unmanaged (plug-and-play).

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Hub
Function: Broadcasts incoming data to all ports regardless of destination.

Use Case: Rarely used today due to inefficiency.

#### Key Features:

Works at the Physical Layer (Layer 1).

No intelligence â€“ causes data collisions.

#### Types:

Active Hub: Amplifies signals.

Passive Hub: Only splits the signal, no amplification.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Modem
Function: Converts digital data from a computer into analog for phone lines and vice versa.

Use Case: Provides internet by connecting with your ISP.

#### Key Features:

Stands for Modulator-Demodulator.

Used in DSL, cable, or fiber connections.

Usually built-in with routers today.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Access Point (AP)
Function: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

Use Case: Extends Wi-Fi coverage in buildings.

#### Key Features:

Connects to a switch or router.

Broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal for client devices.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Network Interface Card (NIC)
Function: A hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network.

Use Case: Installed in computers and laptops.

#### Types:

Wired NIC (Ethernet)

Wireless NIC (Wi-Fi)

Modern Computers: Usually have both wired and wireless NICs built-in.

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Bridge
Function: Connects two different LANs and filters traffic.

Use Case: Splits traffic to reduce collisions in busy networks.

#### Key Features:

Works at Data Link Layer (Layer 2).

Learns MAC addresses to forward data correctly.

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Gateway
Function: Acts as a translator between different network protocols.

Use Case: Used when two different types of networks need to communicate (e.g., LAN to the internet).

#### Key Features:

Works at All OSI layers.

Used in VoIP, email, and cloud communications.

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Repeater
Function: Boosts and regenerates signals to extend network range.

Use Case: Used to extend LAN or Wi-Fi signals.

#### Key Features:

Operates at Physical Layer (Layer 1).

Helps in overcoming signal attenuation over distance.

### ðŸ”¹ 10. Firewall (Hardware-based)
Function: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.

Use Case: Protects a network from external threats.

#### Key Features:

Can be standalone hardware or part of a router.

Filters based on IP, port, or protocols.
